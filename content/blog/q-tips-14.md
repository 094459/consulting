### Tip 14 - Guiding Amazon Q : Navigating through your prompt history

In one of the earlier tips I covered why I enable the auto-update for the Amazon Q Developer plugin. It seems that every week, sometimes daily, we get cool new updates and features. Today's tip covers a really nice improvement. For those of you familiar with using the bash/zsh shells, (and not forgetting my days using Powershell too), you could recall previous prompts using the up and down arrow key.

In my daily review of the Amazon Q Developer plugin [release log](https://github.com/aws/aws-toolkit-vscode/releases) I got excited by the following:

```
Feature Navigate through prompt history by using the up/down arrows
```

You can now use the up and down arrows to cycle through your previous prompts. You can see this in the following short video

**Things to know**

The prompt history only exists for the current sessions, so once you exit VSCode, all those prompts are not persisted and when you re-start VScode.
