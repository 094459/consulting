This post was inspired by my colleague Matheus,  who has used the [aws spinning wheel](https://github.com/aws/aws-ops-wheel) (see [blog post here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/the-wheel/)) to help make running re:Cap's a little more interesting and fun.

That is a really neat solution, but I didn't want to use that project as it was a little more comprehensive than I needed. As it is the new year, and I am starting to get hands on with all the really cool new features in Amazon Q Developer announced at re:Invent 2024, I thought I would create a simpler version.

The code generated by Amazon Q Developer can be found in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/094459/q-developer-spinning-wheel).


### 1. Creating the data model

When I think about what I want to create, I can articulate my data model as such:

>Create a data model for a spinning wheel application. The spinning wheel will be a graphical wheel which has a number of different categories that be can be defined within the data model. Each category will have a unique name. Each category will be of equal value. A set of categories can be organised as a group called "wheels". Generate this as SQL that will work with sqlite.

I review the output, and create a file called "spinning-wheel.sql" in a new folder called "data".

### 2. Setting up some scaffolding

I like to create scaffolding to help Amazon Q Developer provide more consistent output, aligned to what I want. I create the following assets in a new folder called "project" called "project-scaffold.md"

```
When creating new Python code, use the following guidance

- Use Flask
- Generate code using the following structure and layout

├── static/
├── models/
├── routes/
├── templates/


```

### 3. Using /dev to generate the core of the code

I am now ready to use Amazon Q Developer Agent for software development (/dev) to generate the code of the code. This is the prompt I use.

```
/dev Build a simple Spinning Wheel application using Python Flask framework. 

- Use the data mode in the sql/spinning-wheel.sql
- Generate a web application that can be used in a browser 
- Users can create a new Spinning Wheel and assign it a name, and add categories they want that spinning wheel to have
- Users can "Spin the Wheel" by clicking on a button
- The Spinning Wheel will be displayed graphically, will be circular, and have equal sized segments for each category, with the text of that category displayed along the segment
- When the "Spin the Wheel" is clicked, the Spinning Wheel will rotate and stop at a random category
- As the Spinning Wheel turns, it will play the audio sound in the audio directory
- Once the Spinning Wheel has stopped it will display the selected category
- There should be a "Play Again" link to allow the Users to do another spin
- The homepage should display available Spinning Wheels that are available to be played
-  Provide a simple web design that can be updated easily using CSS
-  Review project layout details in project-scaffold.md
```

After a few minutes I can see that it has started to review the files already created, and is now generating code for this application.

After about 8 minutes, it has finished.

It has created the bulk of the application, and this is what I now have to work with.

```
├── app.py
├── data
│   ├── spinning-wheel.db
│   └── spinning-wheel.sql
├── models
│   ├── category.py
│   └── wheel.py
├── project-standards
│   └── project-scaffold.md
├── routes
│   └── main.py
├── static
│   ├── audio
│   │   └── spin-sound.mp3
│   ├── style.css
│   └── wheel.js
└── templates
    ├── base.html
    ├── category_form.html
    ├── index.html
    ├── wheel.html
    └── wheel_form.html
```

As you can see, it has tried to stick to the scaffolding that I had in the project workspace before invoking /dev.

### 4. Run and debug issues

After installing dependencies (which I ask Amazon Q to help me with), the application runs, but I encounter my first issue. When creating a new Spinning Wheel (fine), I can add categories (all good) but as soon as I click on the "Back to homepage" link, I get an error.

I wrote up about how to use Amazon Q Developer to help optimise debugging/fixing errors a few weeks ago ([Amazon Q Developer Tips: No.23 Debugging with Amazon Q](https://dev.to/aws/amazon-q-developer-tips-no23-debugging-with-amazon-q-11ee)) and so I follow the tips outlined, making sure that I have the right context and files open, before using Amazon Q Developer chat interface to help me.

![Using Q to fix error](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cluulcxptxonycigqae2.png)

The output looks good, although it seems to have made some errors, specifically with the name of the Flask templates created. I alert Amazon Q Developer to this.

![Tweak the prompt](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/vgga0pokvo3uzk2zejxz.png)

And after apologising (no need to really, I appreciate your help!) it provides me with updated instructions.

![Issue fixed](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/txhxfdjfpp6zuf0koye5.png)

When I now go back, the application is working and I can create spinning wheels, add categories and take them for a spin.

### 5. Improve the application and add new features

The app is working great, but this is where I now use Amazon Q Developer to help me iterate and quickly add new features. Specifically there is something I want to change, and something I want to add.

I ask Amazon Q Developer to help me change how the winning category is displayed, and very quickly I have a nice animation that was way better than before.

I then ask it to change the audio so that it changes and responds in relation to the velocity of the spinning wheel. Again, another easy fix for Amazon Q Developer which would have taken me probably way more time that is useful.

Finally, I want to add a new feature to be able to delete spinning wheels, and in a few minutes I now have this feature.

### 6. Go check it out yourself

I have uploaded the code to [this GitHub repository] so you can check this out for yourself. Here is the spinning wheel in action.
