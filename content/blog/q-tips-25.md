These tips borrow heavily from work that other developers and builders have shared, so I would love to acknowledge folks like AWS Community Builder Christian Bonzelet, AWS Hero Matt Lewis, and Massimo Re Ferre for all the excellent content they put together and share.

Hopefully these tips will help you accelerate your understanding and use of Amazon Q Developer. Remember that regular use will generate muscle memory in effective use of these tools.  They might not be suitable for everything we do as developers, when they are a very powerful tool when used appropriately.

> **Moving fast!** One thing to remember is that these tips are a moment in time, in an area that is moving super fast. I will review and update these as things change.

**Amazon Q Developer IDE cheat-sheet**

Massimo Re Ferre has put together the ultimate Amazon Q Developer cheat sheet which you can access [here](https://it20.info/misc/html-pages/amazon-q-ide-table.html). It provides a useful overview of all the Amazon Q Developer tools together with information such as context availability, supported languages, links to documentation and more. 

**Beyond development**

In this series of tips I have explored just the Amazon Q Developer from within the IDE. Amazon Q Developer provides developers much more capability beyond the editor. You can use it within the command line, from within the AWS console, within specific AWS services, and more.

Amazon Q Developer is not just for Christmas - its a new way of working. I hope that these tips have been useful and that they inspire some of you to try it out over the festive period.
